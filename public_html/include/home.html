                        The <strong>GNU EWE (GNU’s Not Unix — Experimenting With Electronics)</strong>, is a
                        Linux-focused open-source project designed to help users
                        learn by doing. Through a combination of web tools, scripts, and hands-on guides, GNU EWE
                        encourages exploration, experimentation, and learning through trial and error in Linux and
                        electronics.

                        <li><strong>GNU</strong> → softly like “Gah-New” (the antelope)</li>
                        <li><strong>EWE</strong> → like “YOU” (the female sheep)</li>
                </ul>

                        Whether you’re configuring a server, developing scripts, managing a web interface, or tinkering
                        with electronics in your home lab, this project empowers you to explore, experiment, and grow
                        your skills in a supportive environment.
