# GNUEWE 
## Document Viewer (Experiment)

This experiment started as a test with **AI + agents + GitHub** — seeing how far simple generated code could go.  
It turned into a drop-in **Markdown document viewer** for GNUEWE projects.

- Auto-generates navigation from `docs/`
- Renders Markdown to HTML (basic parser)
- Includes outline + dark mode toggle
- Responsive layout for desktop/mobile

⚡ Not a finished tool — just an experiment to explore workflows between humans, AI, and open source projects.
