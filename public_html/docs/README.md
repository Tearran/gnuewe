# Welcome

The **GNU EWE (GNU’s Not Unix — Experimenting With Electronics)** is a Linux-focused open-source project designed to help users learn by doing. Through a combination of web tools, scripts, and hands-on guides, GNU EWE encourages exploration, experimentation, and learning through trial and error in Linux and electronics.

## Pronunciation Tip

- **GNU** → softly like “Gah-New” (the antelope)
- **EWE** → like “YOU” (the female sheep)

Whether you’re configuring a server, developing scripts, managing a web interface, or tinkering with electronics in your home lab, this project empowers you to explore, experiment, and grow your skills in a supportive environment.
